# Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow
For a course in WS19/20 of the University Osnabrück, I here upload the homework submissions from our group.  

Group members: 
- Daniel Menzel (https://github.com/me-daniel)
- Ramon Zacharias (https://github.com/R3yman)
- Florian Pätzold (https://github.com/Flosener).

Content:
- HW1: Implementation of a perceptron from (numpy) scratch, able to solve simple linearly separable logical gates
- HW2: Multi-layer perceptron from (numpy) scratch, now also able to solve non-linear problems, like XOR gate
- HW3: MLP implementation in TensorFlow
- HW4: Simple artifical neural network solving binary image classification in the MNIST dataset
- HW5: Classifier for the CIFAR10 dataset
- HW6: Applying knowledge on the FashionMNIST kaggle challenge

**Credits for all homeworks go to the lecturer Prof. Dr. Gordon Pipa and tutors Luke Effenberger, Anna Jungeilges, Leon Schmid, Sahar Niknam of this course.**
